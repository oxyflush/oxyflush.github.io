<center>Cholera and its causes and effects in Victorian London</center>
</h1>
<br>


<p>
  Cholera was an especially virulent and large problem during Victorian times. Cholera, as we understand it today, is a bacterial disease transmitted through contaminated food or water which can cause numerous symptoms, among which are diarrhea and dehydration. However, the Victorians had a very different understanding on cholera both on how it was transmitted and on how it should be dealt with. The popular view of the time was that cholera was transmitted through filth and smells, specifically those caused by “rookeries” or filth created by “lodging houses” or other crowded poor spaces. 
</p>


<p>
  A “rookery” is a term that is generally used for describing breeding colonies of birds. However, the Victorians also knew the term “rookery” as a place where diseases, especially cholera, were “bred”. More specifically, it referred to “densely populated, low-quality housing found within slum areas. They were overcrowded, scantily equipped, poorly ventilated, and unhygienic. Many families lived within a small, single room.” <a href="#f1" class = "smoothScroll">[1]</a>. Victorians also used the term rookery to refer to other dirty spaces which were thought to propagate diseases such as cow-sheds, slaughterhouses, boiling houses, bone stores, and many more. Because these places definitely had a terrible odor about them, people began to complain. Thomas Beames, in his book “The Rookeries of London” talks about the proximity of these rookeries to living spaces and its link to disease as well as broadens the rookery definition to include industrial places of filth. Beames broadens the definition of rookeries by making an important distinction that rookeries are “not always such dens of destitution as those of St. Giles” going on further to say that slaughterhouses, and cow-sheds, and many more should also be included in the definition <a href = "#f2" class = "smoothScroll">[2]</a>. Beames also identifies the rookeries as the cause of the disease, stating that “this fearful mortality [cholera] was inflicted on us solely through the agency of Rookeries, - they they foci of the disease, the rallying points, beckoning its attacks” as well as noting that places which don’t contain the same filth as the rookeries such as hospitals and well-regulated public institutions have been spared from cholera, leading to Beames’s assumption that the disease must be caused and propagated by the rookeries themselves <a href = "#f3" class = "smoothScroll">[3]</a>. Beames utilizes evidence of diseases around “rookeries” and thus uses it as an argument to take down rookeries. Because diseases appear to be where rookeries are and because of the stark contrast between institutions that are regulated by the government and those that are not (rookeries), it is logical to Beames that in order to control disease, especially cholera, the rookeries will need to be destroyed or at least regulated to some degree. Others also supported Beames’s view on this rookery theory: The Annual Register of 1849, a respectable text on what appears to be a broad overview on the happenings of the year, states that the Central District, St. Giles, the Strand, Clerkenwell, and East London all “suffered much, though not to the extent that might have been anticipated, considering the rookeries within them”, showing their surprise at the number of casualties in relation to the proximity to rookeries <a href = "#f4" class = "smoothScroll">[4]</a>. The London Medical Gazette, a medical journal at the time, also accepts the rookery theory, telling the reader that “The rookery and other bad streets contributed among other things to raise the mortality of St. Giles district to 48.” <a href = "#f5" class = "smoothScroll">[5]</a>. Furthermore, John Stevenson Bushnan, a doctor, also describes the effect of rookeries on cholera. Bushnan quotes a poem describing rookeries in order to support his views: “I turn’d into an alley ‘neath the wall, And stepp’d from earth to hell! - The light of Heaven, The common air was narrow, gross, and dim; The tiles did drop from the eaves; the unhinged doors Totter’d o’er inky pools, where reek’d and curdled The offal of a life” describing a rookery in vivid detail <a href = "#f6" class = "smoothScroll">[6]</a>. The nature of the poem gives insight into how unsanitary and disgusting the rookeries were perceived by the Victorians and thus provides insight as to how and why the rookery theory of spreading disease and filth even gained traction in London. Through these primary sources gathered from the time period, it can be said that the rookery theory proposed by Thomas Beames gained traction even in the medical world. This idea of rookeries being centers of disease spreading in London might also stem from the fact that these places were often extremely filthy and would also tie into the popular belief at the time that diseases were transmitted through filth and smells. Thus, it would not be outrageous to propose that rookeries, centers of filth and bad smells, would be the cause of cholera and other diseases.

Victorians also believed that in addition to bad smells, cholera was also spread when lots of people were in close proximity to each other or filth. Thus, Victorians began to examine “lodging houses” more closely. Lodging houses are places in which the poor could pay a fee and then spend a night in the house, away from the cold. This was hardly a step up from homelessness, and the conditions in the house were usually not very good. Beds were clustered together and the place itself was not usually cleaned. Thus, it became a principal example of how filthy unregulated places allowed diseases especially cholera to spread. In 1851, the Parliamentary debates on cholera identified unregulated lodging houses as a cause for the disease. When comparing the Model Lodging-house, a regulated house of 500 inhabitants all living under the same roof,  and the Peahencourt, a unregulated lodging house, it was stated that when cholera broke out, the Model Lodging-house did not lose a single person, however, Peahencourt lost seven people <a href = "#f7" class = "smoothScroll">[7]</a>. This was strong evidence at the time for the regulation of lodging houses in order to help control the spread of cholera. Effectively scaring parliament, this debate sparked change and  legislation was passed. In 1851, the Lodging Houses Act was passed which called for the regulation of lodging houses so that filth and disease could not spread there. After this legislation passed, people began to report better conditions. In particular, a letter sent by the General Board of Health to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the board described the “sanitary results of the regulation of common lodging-houses, under the Earl of Shaftesbury’s Act, have been so remarkable that it appears necessary to make some allowance for imperfect information on the subject.” further going on to explain that the lodging houses “used to be dens of filth, disease, and crime until put under the inspection of police” <a href = "#f8" class = "smoothScroll">[8]</a>. It is apparent that the Victorians thought that the lodging houses were indeed places where Cholera were spread and the regulation of these houses produced incredible results. Like the rookeries, Victorian beliefs of disease spreading through poverty, filth, and smells, drove them to direct their attention to places containing just these qualities. Their legislation and writings reflect the views they held on disease transmission at the time and thus provide insight into their reasoning.

Victorians differed on how to best deal with the cholera epidemic. However, their methods did overlap because of the common belief at the time that the smells and filth caused the epidemic along with the rookeries and lodging houses. Because of this, it became apparent that a logical solution would be to remove the filth. James John Scott explains in his book that because of the nature of cholera and the way it spreads, “whenever there is accumulation, stink, or soakage, of house-refuse, or of other decaying animal or vegetable matter, the nuisance should as promptly as possible be abated, and precaution should be taken not to let it recur.” <a href = #f9 class = "smoothScroll">[9]</a>, further providing insight into how cholera was to be handled. Because removing the refuse would remove the stench from the general area, it seemed logical that dealing with waste would involve the removal of things that caused stench. However, not all prevention methods advocated by Victorians supported this. Joel Shew recommends very unusual precautions to take in his book, urging his readers to suppress their anger because it would bring on cholera. In addition, other things such as excessive grief, mental suffering, mental distress from want, and even sympathy all contribute to cholera’s spread <a href = "#f10" class = "smoothScroll">[10]</a>. As evidenced by Joel Shew, not all methods for preventing cholera would be considered effective today. However, it is important to note that the Victorian’s incomplete understanding of cholera would have contributed to the rise of theories such as this. But as a whole, the Victorians generally leaned towards the removal of smells, again, indicative of the theories that existed during the epidemic. As times became more urgent, especially with the The Great Stink in 1858, Victorians began shifting their legislature into sanitation which greatly reduced the spread of cholera and improved city conditions.
