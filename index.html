<center>Cholera and its causes and effects in Victorian London</center>
</h1>
<br>


<p>
  Cholera was an especially virulent and large problem during Victorian times. Cholera, as we understand it today, is a bacterial disease transmitted through contaminated food or water which can cause numerous symptoms, among which are diarrhea and dehydration. However, the Victorians had a very different understanding on cholera both on how it was transmitted and on how it should be dealt with. The popular view of the time was that cholera was transmitted through filth and smells, specifically those caused by “rookeries” or filth created by “lodging houses” or other crowded poor spaces. 
</p>

<p>
  A “rookery” is a term that is generally used for describing breeding colonies of birds. However, the Victorians also knew the term “rookery” as a place where diseases, especially cholera, were “bred”. More specifically, it referred to “densely populated, low-quality housing found within slum areas. They were overcrowded, scantily equipped, poorly ventilated, and unhygienic. Many families lived within a small, single room.” <a href="#f1" class = "smoothScroll">[1]</a>. Victorians also used the term rookery to refer to other dirty spaces which were thought to propagate diseases such as cow-sheds, slaughterhouses, boiling houses, bone stores, and many more. Because these places definitely had a terrible odor about them, people began to complain. Thomas Beames, in his book “The Rookeries of London” talks about the proximity of these rookeries to living spaces and its link to disease as well as broadens the rookery definition to include industrial places of filth. Beames broadens the definition of rookeries by making an important distinction that rookeries are “not always such dens of destitution as those of St. Giles” going on further to say that slaughterhouses, and cow-sheds, and many more should also be included in the definition <a href = "#f2" class = "smoothScroll">[2]</a>. Beames also identifies the rookeries as the cause of the disease, stating that “this fearful mortality [cholera] was inflicted on us solely through the agency of Rookeries, - they they foci of the disease, the rallying points, beckoning its attacks” as well as noting that places which don’t contain the same filth as the rookeries such as hospitals and well-regulated public institutions have been spared from cholera, leading to Beames’s assumption that the disease must be caused and propagated by the rookeries themselves <a href = "#f3" class = "smoothScroll">[3]</a>. Beames utilizes evidence of diseases around “rookeries” and thus uses it as an argument to take down rookeries. Because diseases appear to be where rookeries are and because of the stark contrast between institutions that are regulated by the government and those that are not (rookeries), it is logical to Beames that in order to control disease, especially cholera, the rookeries will need to be destroyed or at least regulated to some degree. Others also supported Beames’s view on this rookery theory: The Annual Register of 1849, a respectable text on what appears to be a broad overview on the happenings of the year, states that the Central District, St. Giles, the Strand, Clerkenwell, and East London all “suffered much, though not to the extent that might have been anticipated, considering the rookeries within them”, showing their surprise at the number of casualties in relation to the proximity to rookeries <a href = "#f4" class = "smoothScroll">[4]</a>. The London Medical Gazette, a medical journal at the time, also accepts the rookery theory, telling the reader that “The rookery and other bad streets contributed among other things to raise the mortality of St. Giles district to 48.” <a href = "#f5" class = "smoothScroll">[5]</a>. Through these primary sources gathered from the time period, it can be said that the rookery theory proposed by Thomas Beames gained traction even in the medical world. This idea of rookeries being centers of disease spreading in London might also stem from the fact that these places were often extremely filthy and would also tie into the popular belief at the time that diseases were transmitted through filth and smells. Thus, it would not be outrageous to propose that rookeries, centers of filth and bad smells, would be the cause of cholera and other diseases.
